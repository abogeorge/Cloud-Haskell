## Description
--------------
* Example of using Haskell for developing distributed appliations. Cloud Haskell is a set of libraries that bring Erlang-style concurrency and distribution to Haskell programs. This project is an implementation of that distributed computing interface, where processes communicate with one another through explicit message passing rather than shared memory.

## Setup
--------
#### Prerequisites
* Working Haskell environment (https://www.haskell.org/downloads)
* stack, a popular build tool for Haskell projects(https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/wiki/Downloads)
